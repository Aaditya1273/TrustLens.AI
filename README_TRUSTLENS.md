## 🔬 How Our Trust Scoring System Works

**Transparency is at the core of TrustLens.AI.** We believe users should understand exactly how we calculate trust scores to make informed decisions. Our scoring system uses a multi-layered approach that analyzes various aspects of wallet behavior and history.

### 🧮 Comprehensive Data Analysis

Our system evaluates wallets across **6 key categories**:

#### 1. **Basic Metrics** 📊
- **Wallet Age**: Older wallets (>365 days) receive higher trust scores
- **Transaction Count**: Active wallets with consistent transaction history
- **Balance Analysis**: Current ETH balance and USD equivalent
- **Activity Patterns**: Regular vs. sporadic transaction patterns

#### 2. **Behavioral Analysis** 🎯
- **DeFi Protocol Interactions**: Engagement with legitimate DeFi platforms (Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
- **Smart Contract Usage**: Number of unique contracts interacted with
- **NFT Activity**: Participation in NFT ecosystems and collections
- **Bridge Usage**: Cross-chain activity indicating sophisticated usage

#### 3. **Identity & Social Verification** 🆔
- **ENS Domain Ownership**: Verified domain names add significant trust
- **Social Connections**: Links to GitHub, Farcaster, Lens Protocol, Twitter
- **Verified Credentials**: Number of authenticated social profiles
- **Community Participation**: Engagement in legitimate Web3 communities

#### 4. **Risk Detection** ⚠️
- **Blacklisted Interactions**: Connections to known malicious addresses
- **Wash Trading Patterns**: Detection of artificial volume generation
- **MEV Involvement**: Participation in Maximum Extractable Value activities
- **Flash Loan Usage**: Frequency of flash loan transactions
- **Sandwich Attacks**: Detection of predatory trading behavior

#### 5. **Network Analysis** 🕸️
- **Address Clustering**: Connections to other wallets in the network
- **Centrality Metrics**: Position within the broader Ethereum network
- **Known Address Connections**: Links to verified exchanges, protocols, or entities
- **Suspicious Pattern Detection**: Algorithmic detection of coordinated behavior

#### 6. **External Reputation** 🏆
- **Chainalysis Scores**: Integration with professional blockchain analytics
- **Elliptic Ratings**: Cross-reference with compliance databases
- **Crystal Intelligence**: Additional risk assessment data
- **Community Reports**: Crowdsourced reputation information

### ⚖️ Weighted Scoring Algorithm

Our **AdvancedTrustScorer** uses a sophisticated weighted algorithm:

```
Trust Score = Σ(Feature_Value × Feature_Weight × Confidence_Level)
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Positive Indicators** (ENS domains, DeFi usage, age) increase scores
- **Risk Factors** (blacklisted interactions, suspicious patterns) decrease scores
- **Confidence Levels** ensure uncertain data has less impact
- **Dynamic Weighting** adapts to different wallet types and use cases

### 🎯 Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Trust Level | What It Means |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **85-100** | 🟢 **Exceptional Trust** | Verified identity, long history, extensive legitimate activity |
| **70-84** | 🟢 **High Trust** | Established wallet with good track record |
| **55-69** | 🟡 **Moderate Trust** | Some positive indicators, minor concerns |
| **40-54** | 🟡 **Caution Advised** | Mixed signals, requires careful evaluation |
| **25-39** | 🔴 **High Risk** | Multiple red flags, proceed with extreme caution |
| **0-24** | 🔴 **Critical Risk** | Significant risk factors detected |

### 🤖 AI-Powered Explanations

Each analysis includes **human-readable explanations** generated by our AI system:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts technical metrics into understandable insights
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Considers the specific combination of factors for each wallet
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides specific reasons for the trust score
- **Risk Mitigation Advice**: Suggests precautions based on identified risks

### 🔒 Data Sources & Reliability

**We prioritize accuracy and reliability:**

- **On-Chain Data**: Direct blockchain analysis ensures authenticity
- **Multiple APIs**: Cross-validation using various data providers
- **Real-Time Updates**: Fresh data for the most current analysis
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation if external services are unavailable
- **Cache Optimization**: Fast response times without compromising accuracy

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security

**Your privacy is protected:**

- **No Data Storage**: We don't store analyzed wallet addresses
- **Anonymous Analysis**: No personal information is collected or retained
- **Secure Processing**: All analysis happens in secure, isolated environments
- **No Tracking**: We don't track or profile users of the platform

### 📈 Continuous Improvement

Our scoring system evolves continuously:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Patterns improve over time with more data
- **Community Feedback**: User reports help refine risk detection
- **Regular Updates**: Algorithm improvements based on new threat vectors
- **Transparency Reports**: Regular publication of scoring methodology updates

### 🎯 Why Trust Our System?

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
1. **Clone and navigate to backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   **For Real Blockchain Data (Recommended):**
   - Get a free API key from [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/apis)
   - Add your API key to `.env`:
     ```
     ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # Optional for AI explanations
     ```
   
   **Demo Mode:**
   - Leave `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` empty to use simulated data
   - The app will automatically fall back to realistic mock data

4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Visit `http://localhost:5173`

## 📊 Data Sources

### Real Blockchain Data
When `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is configured, TrustLens fetches real data from:
- **Etherscan API**: Transaction history, balances, contract interactions
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live blockchain data for accurate trust scoring
- **DeFi Detection**: Identifies actual protocol interactions
- **Risk Analysis**: Detects suspicious patterns in real transactions

### Demo Mode (Simulated Data)
When no API key is provided:
- **Realistic Simulation**: Uses statistical models to generate believable wallet data
- **Consistent Scoring**: Same trust scoring algorithm as real data
- **Perfect for Testing**: No API limits or costs
- **Visual Indicator**: UI clearly shows "Demo Mode" status

The app automatically detects which mode to use and displays the appropriate indicator.
