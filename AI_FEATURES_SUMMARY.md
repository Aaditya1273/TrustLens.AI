  - Impact scoring (0-100) for risk prioritization

**Example Output**:

```
🔍 EXPLAINABLE RISK ANALYSIS
1. Significant Net Fund Outflow 🟡
   This wallet shows 100.0% net outflow ratio, indicating more funds leaving than entering...
   Recommendation: Monitor closely. Large outflows may indicate preparation for exit...
```

  - **Trader**: High-frequency traders with multiple counterparties
  - **New User**: Recently created wallets with limited history
  - **Dormant**: Inactive wallets with potential security risks

**Example Output**:

```
🧠 AI BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS
🎯 Trader: Active trader with frequent transactions and multiple counterparties
   Similarity: 80%
```

### 4. 🤖 **Gemini AI Integration**

- **Purpose**: Enhanced natural language explanations and follow-up questions
- **Features**:
  - AI-powered analysis explanations
  - Follow-up question handling
  - Context-aware responses
  - Natural language risk assessment

**Configuration**: Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` file
